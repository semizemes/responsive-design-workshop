# Frontend Learning Practice Project

This repository contains exercises and small implementations created while learning modern CSS layout, styling techniques, and responsive design fundamentals. The goal of this project is to apply each concept in isolation and build a growing collection of practical UI components.

## Topics Covered Along the Way

### Responsive Design
- Responsive layout challenges
- Viewport units (`vh`, `vw`, `vmin`, `vmax`)
- Mobile-first adjustments
- Fluid layouts and media queries

### Typography & Text Styling
- Text transformation (`uppercase`, `lowercase`, `capitalize`)
- Font sizing and line height optimization
- Text readability and hierarchy

### Form Styling
- Styling native form elements for improved usability and appearance
- Input fields, buttons, and form validation states
- Accessible form design patterns

### Flexbox & Layout
- Flexbox `order` property for reorganizing elements
- `box-sizing` for consistent sizing across components
- Alignment and distribution techniques
- Building flexible, responsive layouts

### Scalable CSS Structure
- Modifier classes (BEM: `block__element--modifier`) for clean and maintainable styling patterns
- Component-based CSS organization
- CSS architecture best practices

### Additional Techniques
- General UI refinements and incremental layout improvements
- Experimentation with practical component-level styling
- Modern CSS features and properties

## Purpose of This Repository

This project serves as a hands-on environment to explore key CSS concepts through small, focused tasks. Each implementation is designed to:

- **Isolate specific concepts** for better understanding
- **Build practical skills** through real-world UI components
- **Document progress** as learning advances
- **Create a reference library** of reusable patterns

More components and challenges will be added as learning progresses.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies and run the project:

```bash
npm install
npm start
